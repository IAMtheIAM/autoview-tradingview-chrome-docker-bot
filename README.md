# 24/7 Crypto Trading Bot: TradingView.com Charts plus Autoview = â™¥

TradingView.com provides powerful charting and indicator tools to create robust trading strategies. However, it does not allow automated trading.

Autoview is a chrome extension that bridges the gap between TradingView.com Charts and your exchange and executes trades automatically based on Alerts you program in TradingView.com Charts.

This project aimed at solving the problem of running a bot locally which does not work when the computer is off. A server was needed, and so I created this Docker image to enable myself and anyone to easily fire up a new container that runs Autoview as a service.

While I could have used a Windows VPS and set it up easily through remote desktop, I did not think of it before creating this, and so I created an Ubuntu 16.04 Docker image with an X-server installed and a VNC server to enable VNC connections (remote desktop). It works perfectly at running Autoview as a service and is easy to setup, only a couple simple steps.

# Steps to get up and running:

To use the pre-compiled Docker Image, 

1) Run `docker pull iamtheiam/autoview-bot` 
2) Deploy the image to your server.
3) Follow the steps below.

To build the image from source, clone this repo and then follow these steps:  

`git clone https://github.com/IAMtheIAM/autoview-tradingview-chrome-docker-bot.git`  :

1) Run `npm install`
2) Run `npm run build:docker`
3) Follow the steps below.

## Deployment and Startup

1) OPTIONAL: To automate the process of initially entering your autoview credentials, open `bot-setup.ts` and enter your API key and secret there. To automate logging in to TradingView.com, open `bot.ts` and enter your username and password there
 
2) Create an Unbuntu 17.10 server with at least 2GB RAM

1) Run `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade` to update all dependencies

4) Install Docker and Docker-compose. [See documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-docker-ce)

1) OPTIONAL but strongly recommended, install a strong firewall with bruteforce detection

`apt install apf-firewall`

 To install BFD, see: [http://www.webhostgear.com/60.html](http://www.webhostgear.com/60.html)

 Configure your ports as desired. It is strongly suggested to run your VNC on a non-standard port for security purposes

6) Run `sudo docker-compose up`

7) Connect to your Docker container through VNC Viewer

8) Right click on the Desktop > Applications > Shell > Bash

9) `npm run setup` will run Autoview setup script (and load the Autoview extension automatically)

10) `npm run start` will run Tradingview login script (and load the Autoview extension automatically)

11) Open up a new tab `localhost:9222` and click Autoview. Now you can see the debugging output for autoview to see if its working.

12) Setup your TradingView.com alerts and watch them get triggered automatically 24/7!
