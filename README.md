# 24/7 Crypto Trading Bot: TradingView.com Charts plus Autoview = â™¥

TradingView.com provides powerful charting and indicator tools to create robust trading strategies. However, it does not allow automated trading.

Autoview is a chrome extension that bridges the gap between TradingView.com Charts and your exchange and executes trades automatically based on Alerts you program in TradingView.com Charts.

This project aimed at solving the problem of running a bot locally which does not work when the computer is off. A server was needed, and so I created this Docker image to enable myself and anyone to easily fire up a new container that runs Autoview as a service.

While I could have used a Windows VPS and set it up easily through remote desktop, I did not think of it before creating this, and so I created an Ubuntu 16.04 Docker image with an X-server installed and a VNC server to enable VNC connections (remote desktop). It works perfectly at running Autoview as a service and is easy to setup, only a couple simple steps.

# Steps to get up and running:

To use the pre-compiled Docker Image, 

1) Login via SSH to your server
2) Run `docker pull iamtheiam/autoview-bot`. This will pull the image from the public docker repository I created
3) Follow the steps below.

To build the image from source, clone this repo and then follow these steps:  

`git clone https://github.com/IAMtheIAM/autoview-tradingview-chrome-docker-bot.git`  :

1) Run `npm install`
2) Run `npm run build:docker`
3) Follow the steps below.

## Deployment and Startup
 
1) Create an Unbuntu 17.10 server with at least 2GB RAM

2) Run `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade` to update all dependencies

3) Install Docker and Docker-compose. [See documentation](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-docker-ce)

4) Upload `docker-compose.yml` and `launch-virtual-display.sh` to your server

5) From that same directory, run `sudo docker-compose up`

6) Connect to your Docker container through VNC Viewer. By default it runs on `port 3903` for security. You can change this to any port you want inside the `./launch-virtual-server.sh` script.

7) Right click on the Desktop > Applications > Shell > Bash

8) OPTIONAL: To automate logging in to TradingView.com, `nano bot.ts` and enter your username and password on lines 3 and 4.

9) `npm run setup` will run Autoview setup script (and load the Autoview extension automatically)

1) `npm run start` will run Tradingview login script (and load the Autoview extension automatically). If you did not enter your username and password into `bot.ts`, you will need to manually enter it when the login screen automatically appears after a few seconds (the bot will click login for you).

11) Open up a new tab `localhost:9222` and click Autoview. Now you can see the debugging output for autoview to see if its working.

12) Setup your TradingView.com alerts and watch them get triggered automatically 24/7!

1) OPTIONAL, but strongly recommended: Install a strong firewall with bruteforce detection

`apt install apf-firewall`

 To install BFD, see: [http://www.webhostgear.com/60.html](http://www.webhostgear.com/60.html)

 Configure your ports as desired. It is strongly suggested to run your VNC on a non-standard port for security purposes
